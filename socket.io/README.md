# Structure

socket.io is a tool to make easier to have webSocket in your projects.

In this example we have a basic example of a chat using the socket.io.
Actually there are already an good example of how create a chat in the site
of socket.io, this tutorial you can find <a href="http://socket.io/get-started/chat/">here<a>.


But this example uses Jquery in the front-end, so I created this that example about how use with angularJs.
Also I make it a bit simpler and created a angularJs service that handle the
things of the socket.io.

<h2>Requirements</h2>
In this example we use <b>socket.io</b> to do all the stuff of webSockets to us.
To install it you use:
```
npm install socket.io --save
```
