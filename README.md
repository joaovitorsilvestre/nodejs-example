# About what is that?
I came from Django where login, sessions, database is all
already configured for you. So, I use this repo to add
things that I'm testing and using.

I will use this repository to save examples of how integrate and use
some modules in node.js. And more, I put comments that instruct what each
thing do.

I really take care to follow the <b>bests practices</b> that
I read about. And each folder has they own README that contains tips
and also the best practices that was used in examples.

<h2> You can find examples of </h2>
* Basic structure project MVC with express
* Mongoose to use Mongodb
* Example of unit tests with Mocha & Chai

<h2>Full Example</h2>
The folder called <b>full_example</b> is where I will use to store
more complex examples, but this will be using various modules at the same
time. Because there are a system with sessions, websockets, mongodb, redis, etc.
