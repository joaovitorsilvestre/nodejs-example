# What is this?
It's a script to generate a express project structure. There are already a tool
to do this, that is called express-generator, but I prefer to create my own for
my needs.

<h2>Using</h2>
To use just run the script with two parameters, the name of project and if you
want a 'simple' or 'complex' structure as follows:

```
node generate projectName simple ## or
node generate projectName complex
```
